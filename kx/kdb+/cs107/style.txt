c programming style guide (use c.h)

brevity, locality and consistency. (keep it short - get it right)

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle

1. indentation: 1 space
2. braces: same line  (largely redundant because of indent)
3. spaces: only for indent.
4. names: i,j(index) m,n(count) s,t(string) ..
5. types: I F C S     (largely redundant because of names)
6. functions: short. usually one line. no globals.
7. earlyexit: P Q
8. comments: WHAT but not HOW.

.. nothing extra

don't generalize.
don't optimize.

c programming style guide (use c.h)

brevity, locality and consistency. to get it right keep it short and clear.

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle

1. indentation: 1 space (most simple functions should be on 1 line.)
2. braces: same line (braces are largely redundant. see above.)
3. spaces: only for indent.
4. names: i,j(index) m,n(count) s,t(string) ..
5. types: I F C S (c.h)
6. funcs: short. usually one line. no globals.
7. exit: P Q R
8. comments: WHAT but not HOW. (code says how)

nothing extra. no extra ()'s or {}'s ,e.g.  if(x)a=2; NOT if( x == true ){ a = 2 ; }
don't generalize.
don't optimize.

This library provides a Q server to R.

The Makefile works on l64 and l32. Copy in k.h and the appropriate platform c.o.

The file qserver.R should be changed to suit your installation, in particular use the correct path and filename for the .so file.

See also kx wiki https://code.kx.com/trac/wiki/Cookbook/IntegratingWithR.

Tested with R 2.7 and R 2.8.

Originally developed by Niall Dalton.
